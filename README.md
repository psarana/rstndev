Calculating standard error by hand can be difficult. If for some reason you would like a whole separate package for this function, this package will take in a number and return the standard deviation of that number.

### Useage:

Install this package in RStudio:

```
devtools::install_github("psarana/rstndev")
```

Use:

```
x = c(1,2,3,4)

standard_deviation(x)
```
