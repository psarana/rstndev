Calculating standard deviation and standard error by hand can be difficult. If for some reasons you would like a whole separate package for these functions, this package will take in some numbers and return the standard deviation and standard error of these numbers.

### Usage:

Once you have installed this package, you can directly call the 2 functions:

- standard_deviation(x)

- standard_error(x)
