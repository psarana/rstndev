Calculating standard deviation and standard error by hand can be difficult. If for some reasons you would like a whole separate package for these functions, this package will take in some numbers and return the standard deviation and standard error of these numbers.

### Usage:


Install this package in RStudio:

```
devtools::install_github("psarana/rstndev")
```

Use:

```
x = c(1,2,3,4)

standard_deviation(x)
```
