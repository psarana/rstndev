Calculating standard deviation and standard error by hand can be difficult. If for some reasons you would like a whole separate package for these functions, this package will take in some numbers and return the standard deviation and standard error of these numbers.

### Use:

Included in this package are:
- standard_deviation() : calculate the standard deviation of a group of values
- standard_error() : calculate the standard error of a group of values

```
x = c(1,2,3,4)

standard_deviation(x)

standard_error(x)
```
